# Code Challenge

## FrontEnd, Languages and tools.
The app is deployed on Heroku "https://codechallengefrontfrancocapone.herokuapp.com/". The frontend
is built on React.js and it displays the products
that the API exposes through the backend.
 I used material UI for the components of the app.

### App display
 There are 6 objects displayed on the app's main screen
 I made a basic distribution with grid and used modal to generate a detailed view on click with the description
 modal makes it more clean than opening a new tab

### To improve
  Loading effects, 

### Github
Here's the Github link to the frontend's repository:"https://github.com/FraneCap/code_challenge--Frontend-Franco-Capone-"
